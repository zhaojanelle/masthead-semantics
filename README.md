# Masthead semantics

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- All the content is provided in the `content.txt` file.
- The images are provided in the `images` folder.
- Create an `index.html` and write the semantically appropriate tags for the content.
- Remember to do regular commits.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Understanding the content document

The content document lists the text and image content that should be displayed in the website—it does not show how anything should look.

There are different sets of characters to denote certain features:

- `[]` — denotes a link, means the text inside should be clickable.
- `{}` — denotes that an image should be placed in that location, and what image.
- `---` — denotes a grouping of content.

**The brackets should be removed when putting the content in the HTML file—they are only there to help you understand the features of the content.**

## Goal

**The website will look ugly**—our goal is only to think about which tags are the correct ones for the content. *Don’t worry about how it looks.*
